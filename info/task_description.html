    During traveling, the spaceship carries a lot of stress.
    So an important part of the maintenance is to check the outer shell.
    Stephan uses a digital durabilitimeter.
    This device scan the fragment of the spaceship shell and give a durability map that is divided
    by small square fragments with measurements.
    But sometimes Stephan does not have much time and he can patch only couple points.
    So we need a algorithm to find weak points.
</p>

<p>
    A durability map is represented as a matrix with digits. Each number is a durability measure for the cell.
    To find the weakest point we should find the weakest row and column.
    The weakest point is placed in the intersection of these row and column.
    Row (column) durability is a sum of cell disabilities in that row (column).
    You should find coordinates of the weakest point (row and column).
    The first row (column) is 0th row (column).
    If a fragment has several equal weak points, then choose the top left point.

    <strong>Output: </strong> The coordinates of the weak point as a list (tuple) of integers.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Matrices (2D array) are an often used data structure and it will be helpful to sharp your skills with they.
